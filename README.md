# Laser-Beans-Source

Unity scripts for the game Laser Beans made for the Brackeys 2021.1 Game Jam. This is an event where game developers have one week to build a game from scratch to fit the theme "Stronger Together".

All scripts were written by me except for parts within SaveLoadLightMaps where import properties are copied over, and where light probe data is calculated.

Feel free to download and play the game on a Windows machine at https://tpmccor.itch.io/laser-beans

Rules and details of the game jam can be found at https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5
